            <!-- Emergency Tips -->
            <div class="emergency-tips">
                <h2>What to Do When Locked Out</h2>
                <div class="tips-content">
                    <h3>Stay Calm and Safe</h3>
                    <p>Being locked out is stressful, but staying calm helps resolve the situation faster. If you're outside at night, wait in a well-lit, safe location. If you feel unsafe, call us from your car with doors locked or go to a nearby business.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Don't Force Entry</h3>
                    <p>Never attempt to break windows, force doors, or pick locks yourself. These actions can cause expensive damage and may result in injury. Professional locksmith service is always more affordable than repairing broken doors or windows.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Check for Spare Keys</h3>
                    <p>Before calling, check if you've left a spare key with a neighbor, family member, or property manager. However, if it's late at night or you need immediate access, don't hesitate to call us right away.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Verify Identification</h3>
                    <p>When our technician arrives, they'll verify your ownership or tenancy before providing service. Have ID ready and be prepared to show proof you live or work at the location. This protects you from unauthorized locksmith scams.</p>
